# NVT-Umbrella-Sampling-and-Free-Energy-Profiling-using-WHAM

This repository contains the algorithm for WHAM and given a simple Python implementation of the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM) tailored for 1-D umbrella-sampling data generated from molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations, which use reduce unit.
